## About
StratoBayes is implemented as a package for the R programming language. Please follow the installation instructions below. 

> **Note**: This version of StratoBayes is licenced for non-commercial use only. For commercial inquiries, please [email us](mailto:kilian.eichenseer@durham.ac.uk).

## Installation
<!-- StratoBayes requires [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (at least version 4.1). We recommend accessing R from the [Rstudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) integrated development environment. [do we need to say anything about chosing the right version for the OS?] -->
StratoBayes requires [**R version 4.4.x**](https://cran.r-project.org/) (currently supporting only version 4.4.x binaries). We recommend using R through the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/downloads/).

> Binaries for R version 4.1.x up to 4.5.x and Linux binaries will be added soon.

### Step-by-step guide

1. **Install R and RStudio**:
   - [Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/), ensuring you select the correct installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS Intel, or macOS Apple Silicon).
   - [Download and install RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) corresponding to your operating system.

> If you are unsure which version of Mac you are using, click the apple logo in the top left corner and select “About This Mac”. Check the processor type. "Apple M1", "M2", or later require R for Apple silicon; Intel processors (i5, i7, i9, etc.) require  R “For older Intel Macs".

2. **Confirm R version in RStudio**:
   - Open RStudio.
   - Select your R version via:
     ```
     Tools → Global Options → General → R version
     ```
   - If not already selected, chose **R version 4.4.x** and restart RStudio to apply the change.

3. **Install StratoBayes**:
   Paste the following command into the R console within RStudio:

   ```r
   install.packages("StratoBayes", 
                    repos = c("https://stratobayes.github.io", getOption("repos")), 
                    type = "binary", 
                    dependencies = TRUE)
   ```
   
> **Note**: Currently, StratoBayes binaries are only available for R version 4.4. Ensure your R installation meets this requirement to avoid compatibility issues.


4. **Load StratoBayes:** Paste this into the R console within RStudio:

   ```r
   library(StratoBayes)
   ```


<!-- Once R and Rstudio are installed, open Rstudio. You can select the correct version of R in `Tools`  `Global Options...`  `R version:`, then restart Rstudio.

In the console, type

`install.packages("StratoBayes", repos = c("https://stratobayes.github.io", getOption("repos")), type = "binary", dependencies = TRUE)`

-->

<!-- ### Windows

currently supports R 4.4

### macOS

currently supports R 4.4 for Intel and for Apple silicon

### Linux
