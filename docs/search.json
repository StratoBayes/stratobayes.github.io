    "text": "Installation\n\nStratoBayes requires R version 4.4.x (currently supporting only version 4.4.x binaries). We recommend using R through the RStudio IDE.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\nInstall R and RStudio:\n\nDownload and install R, ensuring you select the correct installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS Intel, or macOS Apple Silicon).\nDownload and install RStudio corresponding to your operating system.\n\n\n\nIf you are unsure which version of Mac you are using, click the apple logo in the top left corner and select “About This Mac”. Check the processor type. “Apple M1”, “M2”, or later require R for Apple silicon; Intel processors (i5, i7, i9, etc.) require R “For older Intel Macs”.\n\n\nConfirm R version in RStudio:\n\nOpen RStudio.\nSelect your R version via:\nTools → Global Options → General → R version\nIf not already selected, chose R version 4.4.x and restart RStudio to apply the change.\n\nInstall StratoBayes: Paste the following command into the R console within RStudio:\ninstall.packages(\"StratoBayes\", \n                 repos = c(\"https://stratobayes.github.io\", getOption(\"repos\")), \n                 type = \"binary\", \n                 dependencies = TRUE)\n\n\nNote: Currently, StratoBayes binaries are only available for R version 4.4. Ensure your R installation meets this requirement to avoid compatibility issues.\n\n\nLoad StratoBayes: Paste this into the R console within RStudio:\nlibrary(StratoBayes)",
