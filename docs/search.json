We can declare tie points either by their height or depth in a chosen reference section, or by absolute age (age-scale alignment). In this example, we use a tie point expressed in height at the reference section:\nWe will be using the above data set, signalData5. An initial model run without using tie points (using stratData5a) shows that the signal of Site 2 could match any one of three distinct positions in the reference site (Site 1):\nlibrary(StratoBayes) # loading StratoBayes\nplot(stratPosterior5a, alignment = 1:3, ylab = \"height (m)\")",

To express our uncertainty on the exact horizon on the reference scale, we use a probability distribution rather than a single value. In this case, we use a normal distribution with mean \\(\\approx\\) 7.85 m and a standard deviation of 1 m.\nWe can include this knowledge with a ties dataframe. Every row of the dataframe represents a tie point and needs a site and a height column.

Instead, we can specify any R probability density in the ties dataframe. Instead of mean and sd, we can provide the name of a probability density function (e.g. \"dnorm\" for the normal distribution, \"dunif\" for the uniform distribution, …) and the numerical arguments that define the distribution, in the order they appear in. If we check ?dnorm, we see the arguments are x, mean, sd and log. The first formal argument of every density function (x) and the optional log argument are supplied automatically by the algorithm, so you should not include either of them.

Tune the parameters – or swap in any R density function – to match your data. For a gamma-distributed tie point (densityFun = \"dgamma\"), arg1 would correspond to the shape, and arg2 to the rate parameter.

This requires to specify the heights of the upper boundaries (tops) of the partitions.\nWhen specifying a hiatus within a stratigraphic sequence, the same height needs to appear twice – first as a hiatus (indicated by an NA in the partition column), and then as the top of the partition below.\n\nNote: At a minimum, the top height of every site must be recorded in the the partition dataframe.\n\nA partition dataframe needs to have the columns site, height, and partition.\n\nInstead of those names, different column names can be used by providing siteColumn, zColumn and/or partitionColumn arguments to the StratData function later on. The former two need to match the column names used in the signal dataframe.\n\nIn this example:\n- For Site 1, the maximum height value (or top of the sequence) is used to define a single partition for the whole site. As we will use Site 1 as the reference site (heights will be unchanged), additional partitions would not affect the analysis.\n- For Site 2, two partitions are specified: one for the part above the hiatus (for which we altered the sedimentation rate earlier) and one for part below.\nTo define the hiatus: - The gap height is included first with an NA to denote the break in continuity.\n- The same height is then specified as the top of the partition below the hiatus.\n\n# Determine the maximum recorded height for each site.\nsite1Max &lt;- max(signalData4$height[signalData4$site == \"site1\"])\nsite2Max &lt;- max(signalData4$height[signalData4$site == \"site2\"])\nhiatus &lt;- 3/2 * pi\nsite2BottomPartitionTop &lt;- hiatus # hiatus height needs to appear twice\n\n# construct the partition dataframe\npartsData4 &lt;- data.frame(\n  site = c(\"site1\", \"site2\", \"site2\", \"site2\"),\n  height = c(site1Max, site2Max, hiatus, site2BottomPartitionTop), \n  partition = c(\"partition site 1\", \"top partition, site 2\", NA, \"bottom partition, site 2\"))\n\n# print dataframe\npartsData4\n##    site    height                partition\n## 1 site1 24.948872         partition site 1\n## 2 site2 23.541414    top partition, site 2\n## 3 site2  4.712389                     &lt;NA&gt;\n## 4 site2  4.712389 bottom partition, site 2\n\nWe can now create a StratData object from the signalData0b and the partsData0b objects with StratData():\n\nstratData4 &lt;- StratData(signal = signalData4, parts = partsData4)\n\nTo visualise the partitions, we can use the show = \"partition\" option of the plot.StratData() function:\n\nplot(stratData4, show = \"partition\", ylab = \"height (m)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can visualise the signals colour-coded by partition as in the figure at the beginning of this tutorial:\n\nplot(stratData4, colourBy = \"partition\", ylab = \"height (m)\")",

We use normal prior for the relative sedimentation rates (on the logarithmic scale) of both partitions.

This prior represents our belief about the number of reference height units (e.g. meters) that correspond to the gap.

Sedimentation rate priors can no longer be specified relative to a reference site, and we need rough estimates of absolute sedimentation rates.\nIn our case, we can use the pair of dated horizons from Site 1 for an a priori sedimentation rate estimate:\n\nsedRateSite1 &lt;- diff(tiesData4$height[c(2,1)]) / diff(tiesData4$mean)\nprint(round(sedRateSite1, 2)) # display result\n## [1] 6.28\n\nWe use\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) (offsets) – We use a normal prior centred on the midpoint between the two dates for Site 1 (4.5\\(\\pi\\)), and a deliberately broad standard deviation of 1 Myr to not “double-count” those ages. For site 2, in the absence of a better estimate, we simply use the mid point of the section and the same broad age uncertainty (specifying “middle” in the alphaPosition argument).\n\\(\\gamma\\) (sedimentation rates) – As we don’t have age estimates from Site 2, will use the log of this estimate as the mean of a normal distributed prior on ln\\((\\gamma) =\\) 6.28 m/Myr on all partitions. To express considerable uncertainty, we set the standard deviation to 1 m/Myr. This implies a 95% prior probability interval ranging from 0.14 to 7 times the mean. Higher or lower values may be sensible in other scenarios, depending on prior expectations of sedimentation rate variability.\n\\(\\delta\\) (hiatus or “gap”) – An exponential prior concentrates probability near zero but has a long tail to account for the possibility of a longer gap. A rate of 1 Myr\\(^{-1}\\) gives a mean prior hiatus duration of 1 Myr and \\(\\approx\\) 95% probability that the gap is &lt; 3 Myr.\n\nStratModelTemplate() lists the required priors, which we can then copy and fill in. Importantly, we have to set alignmentScale = \"age\" to confirm age scale alignment. As there is no reference site, we have to specify an \\(\\alpha\\) prior for every site.\n\nStratModelTemplate(stratData4b, alignmentScale = \"age\", sedModel = \"partition\",\n                   alpha = \"normal\", alphaPosition = c(4.5 * pi, \"middle\"))\n\nWe load the library and specify the priors:\n\nlibrary(StratoBayes)\nstratPrior4b &lt;- structure(list(\n  \"alpha_site1\" = NormalPrior(mean = 11, sd = 1),\n  \"alpha_site2\" = NormalPrior(mean = 11, sd = 1),\n  \"gammaLog_partition site 1\" = NormalPrior(mean = log(sedRateSite1), sd = 1),\n  \"gammaLog_bottom partition\" = NormalPrior(mean = log(sedRateSite1), sd = 1),\n  \"gammaLog_top partition\" = NormalPrior(mean = log(sedRateSite1), sd = 1),\n  \"gap_site2_1\" = ExponentialPrior(rate = 1)),\n  class = c(\"StratPrior\", \"list\"))\n\nTo verify that the priors depict our belief, it is useful to plot them.

For the relative sedimentation rate \\(\\gamma\\), we might initially assume that it may be around 1, which would imply equivalent sedimentation rates in the Staithes and the North Sea section. We use a mean of \\(\\log(1) = 0\\), and a standard deviation of \\(1/2\\).\n\n# fill the prior template\npriors &lt;- structure(list(\n  `alpha_North Sea` = UniformPrior(min = -2000, max = -500),\n  `gammaLog_North Sea` = NormalPrior(mean = 0, sd = 0.5)),\nclass = c(\"list\", \"StratPrior\"))",

In this case, we have no absolute age information, such as radiometric dates. We will thus fit the model on the “height” scale.\n\nSee Age scale correlation and age modelling for an example with absolute ages.\n\nFurthermore, we don’t have information on potential sedimentation rate changes within the sections, e.g. due to lithology changes. We will therefore chose a simple model that assumes a uniform sedimentation rate within each section, but allows for sedimentation rates to differ from site to site.\n\nSee Partitioning data for examples with sedimentation rate changes within sections.\n\nThe model used here will employ two parameters, denoting the offset of Site 2 relative to Site 1, \\(\\alpha_{site2}\\), and the natural logarithm of the sedimentation rate of Site 2, relative to Site 1, \\(\\ln(\\gamma_{site2})\\). The reference site Site 1 remains unchanged. In this model, a sedimentation rate of \\(\\ln(\\gamma_{site2}) = \\ln(3) \\approx 1.1\\) would mean that the sedimentation rate of Site 2 is three times as high as that of Site 1. Using the log-scale for the rate parameters ensures that the prior on the rate is symmetric; a doubling or halving of the rate has equivalent distances on the log-scale.\n\nPriors\nAs we are working in a Bayesian framework, we need to specify priors for those two parameters. The helper function StratModelTemplate() will tell us which priors we need to specify, and provides the code needed to run the model. When calling this function, we will specify that our model should be on the height scale (alignmentscale = \"height\"), since we don’t have dates in our data set, and that our sedimentation rate model will assume a different sedimentation rate at each site (sedModel = \"site\"). We further specify that the offset of Site 2 relative to Site 1, \\(\\alpha_{site2}\\), refers to the middle of Site 2 (alphaPosition = \"middle\"). Here, we will use a uniform prior on the \\(\\alpha\\) parameter, and a normal prior on the \\(\\ln(\\gamma)\\) parameters:\n\nStratModelTemplate(\n  stratData0,\n  alignmentScale = \"height\",\n  sedModel = \"site\",\n  alphaPosition = \"middle\",\n  alpha = \"uniform\",\n  gammaLog = \"normal\"\n)\n## \n## priors &lt;- structure(list(\n##   \"alpha_site2\" = UniformPrior(min = , max = ),\n##   \"gammaLog_site2\" = NormalPrior(mean = , sd = )),\n##   class = c(\"StratPrior\", \"list\"))\n## \n## model &lt;- StratModel(stratData = stratData0,\n##                     priors = priors,\n##                     alignmentScale = \"height\",\n##                     sedModel = \"site\",\n##                     alphaPosition = \"middle\",\n##                     nKnots = 25)\n## \n## result &lt;- RunStratModel(stratObject = stratData0,\n##                         stratModel = model,\n##                         nRun = 1,\n##                         nIter = 1000)\n\nNow, we can copy this template into our script and fill in the priors with appropriate values Our reference section spans the interval from 0.25 to 18.7 m. Using these as the min and max values for the uniform prior on \\(\\alpha_{site2}\\) means that the mid height of Site 2 may fall anywhere within the height range of Site 1. For the normal prior on the log of the sedimentation rate of Site 1 relative to Site 2 we use a mean of 0 (a log sedimentation rate of 0 corresponds to a relative sedimentation rate of 1, i.e. no stretching or squeezing of the signal). We set the standard deviation to ln 2, which places ~68% of the prior probability of this parameter on sedimentation rates between 0.5 and 2.0, with the remaining 32% being allocated to more extreme relative sedimentation rates.\n\nstratPrior0 &lt;- structure(list(\n  \"alpha_site2\" = UniformPrior(min = 0.25, max = 18.7),\n  \"gammaLog_site2\" = NormalPrior(mean = 0, sd = log(2))),\n  class = c(\"StratPrior\", \"list\"))\n\n\nDefault priors\nFor quick exploratory analyses, automatically generated default priors can be used (instead of specifying own priors) by setting priors = NULL in the StratModel() function. See ?AutoPrior for details.\n\n\n\nThe model object\nBefore being able to run the model, we have to create a model object. We can simply use the code suggested by the StratModelTemplate function, but because we have a small data set, we will decrease the number of knots for the splines to 10 (nKnots = 10), which will reduce the run time. Larger, more complicated data sets likely require more knots for the spline to fit the data well.\n\nstratModel0 &lt;- StratModel(stratData = stratData0,\n                    priors = stratPrior0,\n                    alignmentScale = \"height\",\n                    sedModel = \"site\",\n                    alphaPosition = \"middle\",\n                    nKnots = 10)",

Samples from an MCMC are usually autocorrelated, so we use the nThin parameter to thin the samples and keep only every 5th sample by setting nThin = 5. nRun determines how many independent model runs will be conducted. To evaluate whether the model has converged, it is useful to have at least 3 independent model runs starting from different parameter values. Setting runParallel to TRUE allows to process each run on a separate CPU core, which can drastically improves overall run times.

If more than one cluster of possible alignments has been identified, it will display information for each alignment cluster.\n\nsummary(result)\n## \n## Posterior of stratigraphic model from 3 runs after 1000 iterations:\n## \n##   Total samples: 603 (201 per run).\n##   Statistics summarise 300 samples (100 per run), after discarding the first 50% of\n##   iterations from each run as burn-in.\n##   The acceptance rate of proposals across the selected iterations was 26%.\n##   'ess' is a measure of effective sample size, using coda::effectiveSize().\n## \n## Potential scale reduction factor: (Convergence when ~1.00)\n##   alpha_site2    0.98695\n##   gammaLog_site2 0.99650\n##   lambda_value   0.99289\n##   log prior      0.99415\n##   log likelihood 1.00350\n##   log posterior  0.99821\n## \n## Summary statistics for alignment 1 (of 1 alignments), comprising 300 samples (100%):\n##   Multivariate effective sample size of age-height parameters, using\n##   mcmcse::multiESS(): 221.6\n##                    mean      sd     2.5%      25%      50%      75%    97.5%\n## alpha_site2      9.4793 0.12820   9.2237   9.3931   9.4834   9.5659   9.7293\n## gammaLog_site2  1.02157 0.06753  0.90004  0.98159  1.01990  1.06168  1.17065\n## lambda_value    1.27054 0.52861  0.38004  0.87330  1.22261  1.66281  2.38439\n## log prior      -54.6593 2.48593 -60.6952 -55.9351 -54.6993 -53.4221 -51.0014\n## log likelihood -10.5708 3.44423 -18.4717 -12.3448  -9.9689 -8.10230 -5.36462\n## log posterior  -65.2301 2.74834 -71.6141 -66.8425 -64.7992 -63.3411 -61.1239\n##                    ess\n## alpha_site2    147.073\n## gammaLog_site2 235.008\n## lambda_value   300.000\n## log prior      234.090\n## log likelihood 229.736\n## log posterior  248.173\n\n\n\nStratigraphic mapping\nWith our age model, we can now convert any height from Site 2 to the height scale of our reference section Site 1 using the StratMap() function. For example, to give us the heights in section_1 corresponding to a height of 1 m in Site 2, we can use:\n\nStratMap(result, heights = 1, site = \"site2\")\n##   height     mean       sd     2.5%      50%    97.5%\n## 1      1 6.728533 0.258385 6.256851 6.708606 7.218249\n\nThis tells us that a height of 1 m at Site 2 would correspond to a mean height of 6.7 m at Site 1, for this alignment.\nWe can visualise the stratigraphic mapping of heights from Site 2 to the reference height scale from Site 1 using the StratMapPlot() function:\n\nStratMapPlot(result, site = \"site2\")",
